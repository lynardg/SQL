SQL Portfolio 

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This portfolio showcases the SQL projects I have completed, demonstrating my proficiency and skills as a Data Analyst at the entry level.

Sales Analysis: In this project, I analyzed a company's sales data using SQL queries. I retrieved data from multiple tables, performed aggregations, calculated key performance metrics such as revenue, average order value, and customer lifetime value. The project also involved identifying top-selling products, analyzing sales trends over time, and generating insightful visualizations to aid decision-making.

Customer Segmentation: Here, I worked on a project focused on segmenting customers based on their behavior and characteristics. Utilizing SQL, I extracted relevant data from a customer database and performed clustering analysis. By identifying distinct customer segments, I provided actionable insights to optimize marketing strategies, personalize offerings, and improve customer retention.

Inventory Management: This project involved optimizing inventory management for a retail company. I leveraged SQL queries to track stock levels, monitor product turnover, and identify slow-moving items. By analyzing sales data, I recommended appropriate reorder points, identified stockouts, and helped streamline the procurement process to ensure optimal inventory levels and minimize costs.

A/B Testing Analysis: In this project, I conducted an A/B testing analysis for a website. Using SQL queries, I extracted data from the website's database to compare the performance of two different versions of a webpage. I analyzed user behavior, conversion rates, and other key metrics to evaluate the impact of the changes and provide insights on which version performed better.

Customer Retention Analysis: Here, I delved into customer retention analysis for a subscription-based business. With SQL, I extracted data on customer subscriptions, cancellations, and usage patterns. I calculated churn rates, identified factors influencing customer retention, and developed strategies to improve customer loyalty and reduce churn.

These projects demonstrate my ability to work with SQL to extract, transform, and analyze data effectively. I have developed a strong understanding of SQL syntax, data manipulation, and database management. Each project highlights my problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and ability to derive valuable insights from complex datasets.

Thank you for taking the time to review my SQL portfolio. I look forward to discussing these projects further and demonstrating my enthusiasm for data analysis in the context of your organization's goals and objectives.
